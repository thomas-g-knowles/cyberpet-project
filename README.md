# cyberpet-project
M35 group project submission for Cyber Pet game.

The foundation for this project was to develop a simple terminal interface game in Node.js, utilising a third party package "inquirer". We took the concept of Pokemon and tried to adapt it for this style of game. The user is asked different questions and given choices to make, for example choose a pokemon and name it. As the whole project is class/OOP based (one main class "Pokemon" and three extensions for each type - makes heavy use of inheritence), the core mechanic is to change the player's Pokemon's attributes/properties (health and relationship value) based on the decisions they make - the goal of the game can be simplified to keeping your Pokemon alive.
